- 👀 I’m interested in reef-building corals, and ways we can conserve them in the face of climate change!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to study gene expression of different species of reef-building corals in response to heat stress and injury.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to assisted acclimatization and stress-hardening!
